L2 Interview Assessment

# Challenge1:
A 3-tier environment is a common setup. Use a tool of your choosing/familiarity create these resources. Please remember we will not be judged on the outcome but more focusing on the approach, style and reproducibility.

Three-tier architecture is a client-server software architecture pattern in which the user interface (presentation), functional process logic ("business rules"), computer data storage and data access are developed and maintained as independent modules, most often on separate platforms.

# Challenge2:
We need to write code that will query the meta data of an instance within AWS and provide a
json formatted output. The choice of language and implementation is up to you.
Bonus Points
The code allows for a particular data key to be retrieved individually

# Challenge #3

We have a nested object, we would like a function that you pass in the object and a key and get back the value. How this is implemented is up to you.
Example Inputs
object = {“a”:{“b”:{“c”:”d”}}}
key = a/b/c
object = {“x”:{“y”:{“z”:”a”}}}
key = x/y/z
value = a
Hints:
We would like to see some tests. A quick read to help you along the way
We would expect it in any other language apart from elixir.
